# Covid_Deaths_Data
📊 Overview
This project involves an in-depth exploration of global COVID-19 data using SQL. The primary objective is to analyze the pandemic's impact across different countries and continents by examining case numbers, death rates, and vaccination progress. The project follows a structured approach to data analysis, encompassing data cleaning, exploration, and deriving actionable insights. 
🎯 Objectives
•	Calculate daily death percentages and infection rates.
•	Identify countries with the highest infection and death rates.
•	Analyze vaccination progress globally.
•	Utilize advanced SQL techniques such as window functions, CTEs, and temporary tables.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
•	SQL: For data querying and analysis.
•	Microsoft SQL Server: As the SQL client for executing queries.
•	Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset: The dataset used for this project. 
📁 Data Source
The dataset comprises historical COVID-19 data, including details such as total cases, total deaths, population, and vaccination numbers. The data is publicly available and can be accessed from Our World in Data. 
🔍 Data Exploration Process
1.	Data Cleaning:
o	Handled missing values and ensured consistency in date formats.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Calculated death percentages by dividing total deaths by total cases.
o	Determined infection rates by dividing total cases by population.
o	Identified countries with the highest infection and death rates.
o	Analyzed continent-level data to find regions with the highest death counts. 
3.	Advanced SQL Techniques:
o	Used window functions to calculate rolling totals of new vaccinations.
o	Employed Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to structure complex queries.
o	Created temporary tables to store intermediate results for further analysis.
